# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This is a website about my round-the-world trip I did in 2016/2017

It includes 9 pages, of which: 

- 1 index page
- 8 country pages.

The project also includes: 

- a bootstrap file which I have downloaded from the website
- my own CSS stylesheet, in which I have imported Bootstrap styles and then extended them
- an SCSS file which I used to write css style faster as per requirements.
- a mapping file from SCSS to CSS

The index page includes:

- normal structure of an HTML page
- title with link to stylesheet
- div styled with an extended version of the bootstrap container class
- two rows with 4 columns each, styled with Bootstrap
- 8 images
- 16 links of which 8 in the images, 8 in the footer
- jumbotron style top banner
- the images are responsive to hovering, by changing opacity and showing the name of each country visited
- the whole page is responsive to a change in screen size, by stacking up images and reducing size of other page elements.

The Country Pages include:

- normal structure of HTML file
- jumbotron header, with button to go back to index page
- a picture
- a table, style with bootstrap and colours consistent with the colour scheme of the webpage
- an unnumbered list
- a paragraph describing each destination
-a footer with links to other country pages

The SCSS file contains:

- an import from css/bootstrap
- extensions to jumbotron, container, img-fluid, row classes
- hover selectors
- custom made classes
- instances of inheritance
- instances of id
- definitions of variables for the colours use in the website

The CSS file includes:

- the bootstrap library
- extensions, custom classes, selectors, id's, variables as per the SCSS file.
